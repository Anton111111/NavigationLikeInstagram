# Navigation like Instagram

The implementation of navigation with the Bottom Navigation View is the same as in Instagram (with a separate back stack for each tab).

Based on [NavigationExtensions.kt](https://github.com/android/architecture-components-samples/blob/main/NavigationAdvancedSample/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/navigationadvancedsample/NavigationExtensions.kt) 
from [Android Architecture Components Advanced Navigation Sample](https://github.com/android/architecture-components-samples/tree/master/NavigationAdvancedSample)
